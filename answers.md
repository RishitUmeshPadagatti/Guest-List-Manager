# Q1 – Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery

**Question:**  
Describe, with concrete examples, how you would use AI-powered coding or design assistants to accelerate front-end development in a startup where shipping fast matters but code quality can’t slip.

**Answer:**  
I would use AI to design components quickly and efficiently. While I wouldn’t rely on it to design entire pages, it’s very helpful for individual components. Front-end design can be subjective, and I usually aim for a clean, Vercel-style look. For example, in this project, AI helped me create the form, as well as the search and filter functionality in the front end

# Q2 – Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students

**Question:**  
You’re tasked with designing a new AI feature that makes Physics revision easier for Indian class 11 students. Outline two key features and sketch the user journey in plain text.

**Answer:**  
One unique feature I would like to implement is **Push Notification Facts**. This hasn’t been widely implemented, and it could provide students with a predefined routine of revision points delivered through push notifications. The content could be manually added or generated by AI, and notifications could be sent at random intervals throughout the day to encourage regular revision.

Another feature would be AI Explanations during Video Lectures. When a student pauses a lecture, an option could appear for an AI-generated explanation of the paused segment. This is useful when a student doesn’t fully understand a concept and wants a more detailed explanation right at that point in the video.
